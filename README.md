## üíæ SQL Queries  

Below are a few key queries used for data analysis:

### üîπ 1. Total Revenue Before & After Promotions
```sql
SELECT campaign_name,
       ROUND(SUM(base_price * `quantity_sold(before_promo)`) / 1000000, 2) AS total_revenue_before_promo,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE
                   WHEN promo_type = 'BOGOF' THEN base_price * 0.5 * (`quantity_sold(after_promo)` * 2)
                   WHEN promo_type = '500 Cashback' THEN (base_price - 500) * `quantity_sold(after_promo)`
                   WHEN promo_type = '50% OFF' THEN base_price * 0.5 * `quantity_sold(after_promo)`
                   WHEN promo_type = '33% OFF' THEN base_price * 0.67 * `quantity_sold(after_promo)`
                   WHEN promo_type = '25% OFF' THEN base_price * 0.75 * `quantity_sold(after_promo)`
                 END) / 1000000, 2) AS total_revenue_after_promo
FROM fact_events
JOIN dim_campaigns USING (campaign_id)
GROUP BY campaign_name;
```
### üîπ 2. ISU% of Categories During Diwali
```sql
SELECT

    ROUND(
        ((SUM(`quantity_sold(after_promo)`) - SUM(`quantity_sold(before_promo)`)) 
        / SUM(`quantity_sold(before_promo)`) * 100),2
    ) AS 'ISU%',
    RANK() OVER (
        ORDER BY 
        ((SUM(`quantity_sold(after_promo)`) - SUM(`quantity_sold(before_promo)`)) 
        / SUM(`quantity_sold(before_promo)`) * 100) DESC
    ) AS rank_isu
FROM fact_events

				WHEN promo_type = '33%' THEN base_price* 0.67 * `quantity_sold(after_promo)`
				END
				  )- SUM(`quantity_sold(before_promo)` * base_price)) / SUM(`quantity_sold(before_promo)` * base_price) *100,2) AS 'IR%'
FROM fact_events
